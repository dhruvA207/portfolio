# Tic-tac-toe Game Guide

Welcome to our interactive Tic-tac-toe game! This guide will help you understand how to play and use the different game modes available.

## Game Modes

The game offers two different modes of play:

1. **Play vs AI**: Challenge our computer opponent! You'll play as X, and the AI will play as O. The AI is programmed with strategic moves and will try its best to win or force a draw.

2. **2-Player (Same PC)**: Play against a friend on the same computer. Players take turns, with X going first and O second.

## How to Play

1. **Select Game Mode**:
   - Use the dropdown menu at the top of the game to choose your preferred mode
   - You can switch modes at any time by selecting a different option

2. **Making Moves**:
   - The game board is a 3x3 grid
   - Click any empty cell to make your move
   - X always goes first
   - In AI mode, the computer will automatically make its move after you

3. **Game Flow**:
   - Players alternate turns until someone wins or the game ends in a draw
   - Get three of your symbols (X or O) in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to win
   - If all cells are filled and no one has won, the game is a draw

4. **Controls**:
   - Click the "New Game" button at any time to reset the board and start over
   - The status display above the board shows whose turn it is and the game outcome

## Strategy Tips

### When Playing Against AI

- Pay attention to the AI's patterns to predict and counter its moves

- Try to create multiple winning opportunities
